# ethauth

you need a metamask installed into your browser.

TESTING:

`npm start` for starting service out of docker.
then go to http://localhost:3000/login-test and click on login button.

INTEGRATING:
html delivery should be performed by calling webserver instead of the service. So move correspondent lines there (marked as EXAMPLE code in index.js)
